      <title>[Crit Happens!] Nat 20 &amp; Unwind: The Unwritten Favor Part 2</title>
      <description>This Nat 20 &amp;amp; Unwind sits in the aftermath of a heavy chapter. We slow the pace, talk through the choices that mattered, and unpack what it feels like to say goodbye when the dice are not the ones deciding. The table reflects on character growth, quiet consequences, and the emotional weight carried forward into what comes next. Laughter breaks the tension, honesty fills the gaps, and the group takes a needed breath before stepping back into the fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a supporter of this podcast: &lt;a href="https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss"&gt;https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Syndicate Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By scale and by secret, we endure.

      <title>[Crit Happens!] The Unwritten Favor Part 2: The Goodbye</title>
      <description>In this episode, the party faces a quiet moment that carries more weight than any battle. After everything endured, they are forced to stop, breathe, and let go. Choices are made with intention rather than steel, and the cost of the road behind them finally comes due. As plans shift and resolve hardens, the world does not pause to mourn. It watches. The path forward remains open, but something vital is left behind, not in failure, but in honor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a supporter of this podcast: &lt;a href="https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss"&gt;https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Syndicate Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By scale and by secret, we endure.

      <title>[Crit Happens!] The Break</title>
      <description>The fallout of Pyreheart follows the Agents into the mountains. With Kasdeya gone and the Syndicate silent, the team chooses its first move in a fractured world. Their path leads them deep into the Shatterpeaks, where an abandoned watchtower bleeds heat it was never meant to hold. As old wards fail and the land itself pushes back, the Agents realize they are not the first to arrive. The truth waiting inside Frostline Watchtower is deliberate, controlled, and far closer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a supporter of this podcast: &lt;a href="https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss"&gt;https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Syndicate Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By scale and by secret, we endure.

The world has changed, and the next mission will decide who survives what comes next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a supporter of this podcast: &lt;a href="https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss"&gt;https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Syndicate Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By scale and by secret, we endure.

      <description>The third and final U.N.I.T. arc episode begins at the center of the Spiral Chamber as the source of the neomagic instability reveals itself. The chamber reacts in full force, shifting light, twisting shadows, and amplifying every surge the operatives create. The fractured relic at the core awakens, feeding on wild magic and lashing out in unstable arcs.The episode focuses on a sustained battle inside a hostile environment that changes with each action the team takes. Surges shift the terrain. Spikes of arcane pressure interrupt movement. The chamber tests their coordination and control as much as their strength. By the end, the team faces the full power of the instability and must contain or neutralize it before the zone collapses around them, setting the tone for the mission that follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a supporter of this podcast: &lt;a href="https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss"&gt;https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Syndicate Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By scale and by secret, we endure.

      <title>[Crit Happens!] The Toymaker's Regret: Part I</title>
      <description>Snow falls softly on a town dressed for the holidays, where lanternlight glows warm, hearths stay lit, and peace feels almost too easy to find.When people begin to quietly disappear—without fear, without struggle, without alarm. The party is drawn into a mystery that refuses to call itself one. Homes remain warm. Bread stays in the oven. Chairs sit empty, waiting for someone who may never return.As comforting traditions give way to subtle wrongness, the party follows whispers, rumors, and unfinished routines toward something the town insists is kind… even as it feels increasingly impossible.Part I ends at the threshold of a place that shouldn’t exist. Where warmth lingers, music waits, and every visitor is promised one simple truth:Everyone has a purpose.Part II continues next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a supporter of this podcast: &lt;a href="https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss"&gt;https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Syndicate Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By scale and by secret, we endure.

      <description>Follow the team after their fall through the red rift into an unfamiliar zone of cracked black stone and pulsing light. Their Codices activate on their own, warning of unstable readings and a nearby breach source. The squad follows a narrow path toward a circular chamber where the air is silent, the ground vibrates, and the zone begins to react to their presence.As they descend into the Spiral Chamber, the stone echoes, the light shifts, and the environment responds to every movement. Lines of purple energy guide them inward while the pressure of the zone grows with each step. At the center, something waits. The episode builds tension through travel, observation, and rising instability, ending as the team reaches the heart of the chamber and prepares for whatever comes next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a supporter of this podcast: &lt;a href="https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss"&gt;https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Syndicate Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By scale and by secret, we endure.

      <description>The Universal Neomagic Isolation Team, U.N.I.T., deploys into the Echofields after violent wild magic spikes wipe out a full Syndicate scout crew. The landscape loops. Memories slip. Spellcasting fractures into unstable variants. U.N.I.T. navigates the shifting ground while hostile spell-spawned entities stalk the wastes. Every surge grows stronger, and every reading points to something building beneath the surface.As the squad pushes deeper, their stabilizers struggle to hold. Temporal echoes overlap. Identities blur at the edges. The mission shifts from reconnaissance to containment as the team realizes the surges are converging on a single unseen source. The episode ends on a rising harmonic pulse that sweeps across the wastes, drowning out comms and shaking the entire region, leaving U.N.I.T. bracing for whatever comes next.&lt;br /&gt;Follow our socials! https://linktr.ee/CritHappensPodcast Thanks to our Sponsors! &lt;br /&gt;Dungeon Trader: http://dungeontrader.appScrybe Quill: http://www.scrybequill.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a supporter of this podcast: &lt;a href="https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss"&gt;https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Syndicate Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By scale and by secret, we endure.

Their task: reestablish a forgotten Syndicate outpost buried beneath the Ashen Belt, where the torches never stay lit and the walls breathe like lungs.

From corrupted memory checks to zero-gravity combat, this Unwind episode explores how Vault of the Black Star blurred the line between player and experiment.Expect laughter, theorycrafting, and post-mission confessions as the crew compares notes on The Archivist Below and what the simulation might be trying to teach them.&lt;br /&gt;SponsorsDungeon Trader – &lt;a href="http://www.dungeontrader.app" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dungeontrader.app&lt;/a&gt;Kobold Press – &lt;a href="https://koboldpress.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;koboldpress.com&lt;/a&gt;Nomono – &lt;a href="https://nomono.co/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nomono.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Crit HappensInstagram: &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/CritHappensPod" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;@CritHappensPod&lt;/a&gt;Facebook: &lt;a href="https://facebook.com/CritHappensPod" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;facebook.com/CritHappensPod&lt;/a&gt;Twitter (X): &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_CritHappensPod" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;@_CritHappensPod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nat 20 &amp;amp; Unwind is an after-session production of the Scalebound Syndicate.

      <description>Crit Happens: The Lost Missions — Episode 1: Vault of the Black StarWelcome to The Lost Missions — a classified simulation within the Syndicate archives. Agents volunteer for these experimental reruns, testing old contracts and discarded session blueprints buried deep in the Oathbinder’s Ledger.The first reconstruction, Vault of the Black Star, drops the team into the frozen abyss of the Still Cold. Their mission: recover a crystalline key fragment from a long-sealed prison once used to contain The Archivist Below, an entity that devours memory and identity.But this isn’t a real deployment — or so the Overseers claim. Each simulation rewinds fragments of past missions to test new tactics, altered outcomes, and impossible odds. Every variable is recorded. Every death analyzed. Every success erased.The question is no longer if they survive, but what the simulation remembers when it’s over.&lt;br /&gt;Sponsors:Dungeon Trader – &lt;a href="http://www.dungeontrader.app" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dungeontrader.app&lt;/a&gt;Kobold Press – &lt;a href="https://koboldpress.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;koboldpress.com&lt;/a&gt;Nomono – &lt;a href="https://nomono.co/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nomono.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Crit HappensInstagram: @CritHappensPodFacebook: &lt;a href="https://facebook.com/CritHappensPod" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;facebook.com/CritHappensPod&lt;/a&gt;Twitter (X): @_CritHappensPod&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Become a supporter of this podcast: &lt;a href="https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss"&gt;https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/crit-happens--6718900/support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Syndicate Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;By scale and by secret, we endure.

      <title>[Crit Happens!] The Pyreheart Accord: Part 2 - The Arrival</title>
      <description>The Syndicate agents press onward through the choking heat of the Ashen Belt, their mission heavy on every step. After days of travel through ash-choked passes and rivers of molten glass, the silhouette of Pyreheart Stronghold looms — a fortress carved into living magma, where banners of the Dominion flutter beside the silent sigils of the Hollow Host.The party’s approach is anything but simple. Scaling the fortress’s jagged exterior, they brave volcanic gusts, cascading embers, and the echoing hymns of unseen sentinels. Beneath them, the molten caldera hums like a heartbeat — the Accord waits above, its signatories sharpening both quills and knives.Yet as they breach the outer wall, smoke is not the only thing that clouds their path. The agents face choices that cut deeper than steel: mercy or mission, truth or loyalty. In the halls of Pyreheart, even the righteous burn.Creative Use Disclaimer: This podcast is a transformative work based on Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons (5th Edition) under the Open Game License.

      <description>With the weight of a world on the brink of war, the Scalebound agents take one last breath before the firestorm.&lt;br /&gt;Episode One follows the team through the markets of Cindermarch, where ash-forged merchants and relic-peddlers whisper of the coming summit between the Dominion of Fahlreach and the Hollow Host. Between bartering for enchanted steel, memory-ink, and phoenix-proof cloaks, each agent arms themselves for what lies ahead—politics wrapped in prophecy and treachery bound in gold.As the sun bleeds across the horizon, their caravan sets out toward Mount Varron, the volcanic citadel known as Pyreheart Stronghold. The roads twist through glassed ravines and smoking vents where the land itself still remembers the Oracle’s fire.  Strange travelers shadow their path, and distant tremors warn that the mountain is waking.It’s the quiet before the eruption—the moment where steel is tested, faith is questioned, and the first sparks of the Accord begin to catch.Legal Disclaimer:&lt;br /&gt;Crit Happens! is an independent production set within the original world of Virelios.

      <title>[Crit Happens!] Nat 20 and Unwind: After The Curtain Falls</title>
      <description>The stage lights have dimmed, the applause has faded, and the laughter still echoes a little too long. The crew gathers around the table—not for battle, but for breath.Join the cast of Crit Happens! as they unwind after the House of Fun arc: talking through the traps that tested their nerves, the confessions that cost blood, and the lessons hidden behind the jokes. From near-death theatrics to Nyros’ rebirth and Zebulon’s vow of water-only discipline, the players pull back the curtain on what it felt like inside Virelios’ most dangerous carnival.Expect laughter, reflection, and maybe a little chaos as the party decompresses, debates their best (and worst) rolls, and shares what they learned about their characters—and themselves—inside the House that wanted to understand them.“You can’t spell ‘fun’ without ‘uhhh.’”🎙️ A special roundtable episode where the players of Crit Happens! step out of character, pour a drink (or just water), and unpack the madness behind the magic.⚖️ Legal Disclaimer:&lt;br /&gt;Crit Happens! and Nat 20 &amp;amp; Unwind are independent, fan-produced podcasts operating under Creative Use and Fair Play provisions.

      <title>[Crit Happens!] The House of Fun, Part II: Teeth Beneath the Smile</title>
      <description>The laughter fades, but the House isn’t done playing.After surviving the stage and the Goblin’s performance, our Syndicate agents press deeper into the House of Fun, where patience becomes a weapon and the walls breathe in time with the ticking of unseen gears. Traps whisper lessons about virtue, and every choice weighs heavier than the last.Acid swamps, half-spoken vows, and the haunting promise of a final curtain call—this “day off” turns into a descent into spectacle and self. The party will learn what it costs to be clever… and what it means when the applause finally stops.“Glory is cheap. Meaning is expensive.”🕯️ Part II of the House of Fun arc — where the laughter cracks, the truth bleeds through, and every virtue is tested beneath the stage lights.&lt;br /&gt;⚖️ Legal Disclaimer:&lt;br /&gt;Crit Happens! is an independent, fan-produced actual-play podcast operating under Creative Use and Fair Play provisions.
